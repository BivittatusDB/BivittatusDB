# BivittatusDB: Operator-Based Relational Database Management System

This is a Python-based relational database management system (RDBMS) designed from scratch with operator-based functionalities. It's a standalone system not compatible with SQL or NoSQL databases, aiming to provide a simple yet functional database management solution.

## Features
- **Operator-based operations**: The database operates using operators such as `+`, `-`, and `==` to manipulate data.
- **Relational Structure**: Organizes data in tables with rows and columns, following a relational database model.
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Supports basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Indexing**: Efficient data retrieval with indexing mechanisms.
- **Transaction Management**: Implements transaction management to ensure data consistency.
- **Security**: All databases are asymmetrically encrypted with a user defined password for each database.

## Installation
Installation is now available through pip, via the latest release. To get the latest fix (with beta features) use
```bash
pip install bivittatusDB
```
The last build is unavailable via pip at this time. Based on the [release schedule](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/bivittatusDB/wiki/dbed-0001), release 2.0.0.0 should be released 08/01/2025. The closest working version of build 1.0.0.0 available on PyPi is v1.0.0.1
```bash
pip install bivittatusDB==1.0.0.1
```

## Examples
See the examples directory and [wiki](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/PYDB/wiki) for examples off different operations.

## Usage
1. clone the repo and cd into the BivitattusDB directroy
2. Import bivittatusDB into your python file/interpreter.
3. Follow the information from the [wiki](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/PYDB/wiki) for more info on specific usage

## Dependencies
The databases are saved in hybrid-asymmetrically encrypted and therefore need encryption handlers, as seen in the [`requirements.txt`](.github/requirements.txt) file.
```bash
pip install -r .github/requirements.txt
```
